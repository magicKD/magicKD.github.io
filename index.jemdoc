== About Me

I received my bachelor degree in Software Engineering from [http://sdcs.sysu.edu.cn/ School of Data and Computer Science], [http://www.sysu.edu.cn/2012/en/index.htm Sun Yat-Sen (Zhongshan) University], Guangzhou, China (with a rank of 1/174 for the first three years during my undergraduate study).

I am a master student majored in Computer Sciences in [http://http://http://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/ Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences(IIIS)], [http://http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/thu2018en/index.html Tsinghua University].

== Education

*B.S. degree, Sun Yat-Sen (Zhongshan) University*
- majored in Software Engineering from [http://sdcs.sysu.edu.cn/ School of Data and Computer Science] (ranked 1/174)
- Yat-Sen Class in Yat-sen Honor College, an elite liberal undergraduate institution of SYSU

== Research Interests
I have a wide range of interests in game theory, mechanism design, multi-agent systems and blockchain systems. And my research style is interdisciplinary in general. Particularly, I am leveraging mechanism design, mathematics optimization, economics analysis, algorithms design, system evaluation and implementation to tackle the multi-agent systems, blockchain systems and game related problems. I will be very happy if you want to discuss these interdisciplinary fields with me. I am always enthusiastic to investigate different research topics. :)


== Selected Awards
- National Scholarship, 2019 & 2020
- Meritorious Winner of Interdisciplinary Contest In Modeling, 2019
- First Prize of SYSU Outstanding Student Scholarship, 2019 & 2020
- Li Xuerou Foundation Scholarship, 2020 (only 12 recipients in SYSU expect the School of Management, the only one in School of Data and Computer Science, SYSU)

*Rainfall Algorithm: A novel nature-inspired meta-heuristic optimization algorithm*\n
I independently designed and proposed this heuristic algorithm in my sophomore year inspired by the rainy climate in Guangzhou, China. I was surprised to find that this heuristic algorithm can achieve high performance in solving the Steiner tree problem (NP-complete problem). Therefore, I plan to investigate the performance of this algorithm and provide some theoretical analysis.
